"""A value holding a closure that keeps state is never served from the cache,
however deep in the value the closure sits.

A function is stored by reference, so a hit hands back the closure the last
run made, with everything it counted since. Only the value itself and the
containers directly in it were looked at: ``handlers = make_handlers()``
returning ``{"on": {"click": [counter]}}`` was cached, and running the
notebook again handed back a counter that went on from where it was.
