"""Classification and divergence probing for *consumable, unrestorable* inputs.

A **consumable** is an object that is advanced/drained IN PLACE by reading it:
a generator, a ``queue.Queue``, an ``itertools`` iterator, an open file handle.
An **unrestorable** consumable is one the cache cannot faithfully snapshot:
``InMemoryBackend._safe_deep_copy`` (``backends/memory_backend.py``) deep-copies
every stored value, but falls back to storing the *reference* when the copy
raises — so "restoring" such a value hands back the very same, already-drained
object.

Together those two properties break the isolated re-run of a consumer cell: the
cell's required input is a live object that its producer left in one state and
the previous run left in another, and nothing can put it back. The fix is to
re-execute the producer, which is exactly what ``run_all`` does (and why
``run_all`` is already correct for these cases). See CAS-118 / CAS-50.

**Why a bespoke probe instead of the existing content-hash check?**
``object_hashing.compute_hash`` falls back to ``sha256(str(id(obj)))`` for
unpicklable objects. Consumables drain in place, so their identity never
changes and their hash is byte-identical before and after being drained. The
simulator's content-base staleness check therefore *cannot* fire for them; each
type needs its own state observation. These probes are deliberately kept
separate from cache-key derivation — they never touch ``source_hash`` and never
recompute a cache key (see the unified-cache-key rule in
``.github/copilot-instructions.md``).

**Load-bearing distinction: "unpicklable" is NOT "consumable".**
``map`` / ``zip`` / ``filter`` / ``enumerate`` / ``iter(list)`` /
``iter(range(n))`` / ``reversed`` / ``io.StringIO`` are all self-iterators that
drain in place, but they are *deep-copyable*, so the store snapshots them fresh
at ``set`` time and they restore correctly. They must NOT be classified here or
their producers would be re-executed for nothing. Conversely a ``dict.keys()``
view is not deep-copyable but is not a consumable either (re-iterating a view
works fine). Classification therefore requires **both** signals: the object is
a self-iterator *and* it hits the by-ref fallback.
